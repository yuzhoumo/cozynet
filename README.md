# Cozynet

The public web has grown into a cesspool dominated by advertisements, spam,
marketers, bots, and trolls. Top search engine results are saturated with
SEO-optimized listicles, AI-generated slop, and paid promotions. Cozynet is a
search engine designed to index and surface the rare corners of the internet
that are relatively free of commercialization.

Cozynet attempts to exclude sites that contain paywalls, are associated
with commercial entities, contain advertising, or track their visitors. Its
purpose is to make accessible the treasure trove of independent blogs and
digital gardens tended to by passionate individuals seeking to share their
knowledge with others free of profit-driven intent.
