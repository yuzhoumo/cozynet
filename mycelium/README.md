# Mycelium

"The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space
where you can communicate through sharing information." - Tim Berners-Lee

Mycelium is a golang-based web crawler designed to surface personal developer
blogs and niche technical resources written in the spirit of the original web.
Mycelium attempts to profile and avoid sites with ads, trackers, and commercial
or paywalled content.
