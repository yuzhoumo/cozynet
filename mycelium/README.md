# Mycelium

"The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space
where you can communicate through sharing information." - Tim Berners-Lee

Mycelium is a golang-based web crawler designed to surface personal developer
blogs and technical resources in the uncommercialized web. Mycelium attempts
to profile and actively avoid websites with ads, trackers, or commercial
affliations.
